My project is a task management calendar tool that allow user to open the calendar frame 
on their desktop and input task in it. 

HOW TO PUT IN TASK: 
In the empty textField day panel, put in your task, and click in "input" button. 
Once you are done with that task, click the checkbox to mark the completion.

Click Last Month/Next Month to access different month page. However, your previous input of tasks 
will be erased once you move on to another page(This could be improved in the future).

Use the Set Color or Alter Color Palette button to change your calendar page color. 

Day file: day as an extension of JPanel that initialize each day panel
DayName file: dayName as an extension of JPanel to set the bar of monday-sunday label on the top
TaskLine file: taskline as an extension of JPanel that is composed of a Jcheckbox and a JLabel
